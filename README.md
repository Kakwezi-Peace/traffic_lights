The state diagram  represent a traffic control system with four key intersections: East-West Light, West-East Light, North-South Light and  South-East Light. Each of these intersections has its own sequence of traffic light states, which transition cyclically based on timers to manage traffic flow in a coordinated manner. Here's a breakdown of the unique specifications:

 1. East-West Light State:
   - Red State: Traffic moving east-west is halted.
   - Green State: East-west traffic proceeds. This state ends when the timer expires.
   - Yellow State: Indicates the transition period before switching back to red. This state signals east-west traffic to prepare to stop.

   Transition Note: The diagram indicates that after the yellow state expires, the control passes to the
North-South Light.

 2. West-East Light State:
   - Red State: Traffic moving from west to east is halted.
   - Green State: West-east traffic proceeds, allowing vehicles to move through. The transition occurs when the timer expires.
   - Yellow State: The warning phase before returning to red, signaling traffic to slow and prepare to stop.

   Transition Note: The diagram transitions from this state to the South-North Light  after the yellow state completes.

 3. North-South Light State:
   - Red State: North-south traffic is stopped.
   - Green State: North-south traffic flows. This state changes after the timer's duration ends.
   - Yellow State: A brief state indicating that the light will soon change to red, warning drivers to slow down.

   Transition Note: The transition occurs to the  East-South Light  after the yellow state ends.

 4. South-East Light State:
   - Red State: Traffic moving from the south toward the east is stopped.
   - Green State: Allows vehicles traveling from south to east to proceed.
   - Yellow State: Indicates that the green phase is ending, and traffic should prepare to stop.

   Transition Note: Transitions back to the  East-West Light state upon completion of the yellow phase.

 Unique Characteristics:
- Cyclic Nature: The system forms a complete cycle, ensuring that traffic flows in a systematic manner from one route to another before repeating the sequence.
- Timer-Driven Transitions: Each change from green to yellow to red is determined by a fixed timer to control the duration of traffic flow for each route.
- Labeled Arrows: Each arrow connecting the states is labeled as "Timer Expired," indicating that the transitions between states are based on a countdown completion.

 Operational Flow:
1. The system starts at the East-West Light with the red state and transitions to green, followed by yellow, based on the timer.
2. Once the East-West Light completes its yellow phase, the state switches to North-South Light.
3. This sequence continues to the West-East Light and South-East Light, maintaining a consistent rotation.
4. After completing the South-East Light cycle, the system restarts with the East-West Light, ensuring all routes are given priority in turn.

 Purpose and Functionality:
This type of diagram is typically used in traffic management systems where intersections must be controlled to allow traffic from various directions to move safely and efficiently. The clear transitions from one state to the next ensure that all routes are served in a fair and controlled manner, reducing congestion and preventing accidents.
 Custom Features:
- Distinct Route Labels: Each route has unique identifiers, making it easy to associate traffic flow with the specific intersections.
- Consistent Timer Notation: "Timer Expired" is consistently used as a trigger for state changes, emphasizing the system's reliance on timed signals.
- Flow Indicators: The diagram shows the direction in which control moves from one state to another, represented by arrows, ensuring clarity on how the system progresses.

This state diagram is suitable for implementing a traffic control logic that handles multiple intersection points with a focus on timed light sequences and smooth traffic flow management.
